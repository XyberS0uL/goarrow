GoArrow is a plug-in for the game [Asheron's Call](http://ac.turbine.com) by Turbine. It is not affiliated with or supported by Turbine, Inc.  To use GoArrow, you must have an active Asheron's Call account and have [Decal](http://www.decaldev.com) installed.

Features:
  * Displays an arrow on your screen that points towards coordinates that you specify. This is very handy if you have to run to coordinates with obstacles in the way (like mountains), or if you're just directionally-challenged, like me =D

  * Has the ability to find a route between any two locations in Dereth, as well as look up locations' details from either the Crossroads of Dereth atlas or the ACSpedia atlas .

  * Has an interactive surface map and can display maps from ACMaps for any dungeon.
